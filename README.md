# Credit Card Risk Analysis
## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict credit risk.
## Results: 
Below are the imbalanced classification reports for each machine learning model.

## Summary:
All six machine learning models result in good precision scores, but the two ensemble methods have significantly better recall scores than the first four models.  I would recommend the Easy Ensemble Classification model for your company as it has the best recall score.
